# SovolStuff

Welcome to the SovolStuff repository! This repository is dedicated to hosting a collection of enhancements, fixes, and customizations for Sovol 3D printers. It aims to address various issues and extend the functionality of these printers.

## About This Repository

As I encounter and resolve issues with Sovol printers, I document the solutions and provide the necessary scripts and files here to help other users. Each folder in this repository focuses on a specific aspect or issue related to Sovol printers.

### Timezone Folder

The `timezone` folder contains scripts and documentation specifically for updating and managing timezone settings on Sovol printers equipped with a Klipper screen. This enhancement expands the original limited timezone options available on these devices, making it easier for users across different regions to manage their printer settings accurately. [Read more about the timezone mod here](timezone/readme.md).

### Future Additions

As new issues are encountered and resolved, additional resources and folders will be added to this repository. These additions will assist other Sovol printer users in optimizing their devices and overcoming common challenges.
